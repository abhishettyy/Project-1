# 🎵 Spotify-Clone

A clean and modern **Spotify-inspired web interface** built from scratch using **pure HTML and CSS** — with no frameworks, no JavaScript, and no references. This project was a personal challenge to recreate a functional, responsive layout entirely on my own.


## Live Demo
🔗 [View Live Project](https://abhishettyy.github.io/Project-1/)



##  Features:

-  **Navbar** with Spotify-style branding
-  **Recently Played** music section
-  **Spotify Originals & Podcasts** area
-  **User-created Playlists**
-  Smooth **hover effects** on all cards
-  Fully styled **grid/flexbox layouts**
-  Built using **relative CSS units** for better scaling



##  Technology used:

| Tech     | Description                 |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| HTML5    | Structure and semantic markup |
| CSS3     | Styling and responsive design |
| Flexbox  | Layout system for aligning content |
| Relative Units | Used `em`, `rem`, `%` for scalability |



## 📱 Responsiveness

This project is **partially responsive**.  
It uses relative units and Flexbox to adapt to different screen sizes. Full mobile responsiveness will be added as the next improvement phase.



##  What did I learn from this?

- To build a fully structured website **without using any templates or references**
-  Strengthen understanding of **Flexbox**, relative units, and layout design
- Explore how to create scalable and modular CSS
- Practice deploying live projects via **GitHub Pages**
-  The importance of **planning layout flow** before styling
- How **relative units** improve adaptability across devices
- How to structure reusable sections like cards and playlists



## Upcoming Enhancements:

-  Make the layout **fully responsive** for all screen sizes  
-  Add a **footer music player bar** for realism  
-  Add interactivity using **JavaScript** (next phase)  
-  Include a **dark/light mode toggle**
